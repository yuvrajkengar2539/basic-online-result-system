Student Result Management System
This project is a simple PHP and MySQL-based web application that allows students to check their examination results online by entering their roll number and a CAPTCHA code for security. It features an HTML/CSS front-end with a responsive design, a secure PHP backend to prevent SQL injection, and a database to store student marks in multiple subjects. The system calculates total marks and pass/fail status automatically and can also export results to PDF. It includes a sample students.sql file for easy database setup and is ideal for beginners learning PHP, MySQL, and web security basics.
